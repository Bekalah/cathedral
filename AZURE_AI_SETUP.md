sure w# ðŸ”® Azure AI Setup Guide for CATHEDRAL

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up Azure AI integrations in the CATHEDRAL project, ensuring balanced data processing without censorship.

## Prerequisites
- Azure subscription with credits
- Access to Azure Portal
- Basic knowledge of environment variables

## Step 1: Create Azure Cognitive Services Resources

### OpenAI Service
1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Search for "Cognitive Services" and create a new resource
3. Select "OpenAI" as the kind
4. Choose your subscription, resource group, and region
5. Set name (e.g., "cathedral-openai")
6. Review and create

### Computer Vision Service
1. Create another Cognitive Services resource
2. Select "Computer Vision" as the kind
3. Set name (e.g., "cathedral-vision")
4. Note the endpoints and keys for both services

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Add the following to your `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Azure OpenAI
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-openai-resource.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=your-openai-api-key
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4-vision-preview

# Azure Computer Vision
AZURE_COMPUTER_VISION_ENDPOINT=https://your-vision-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com/
AZURE_COMPUTER_VISION_KEY=your-vision-api-key
```

## Step 3: Test Integration

Run the following in your terminal:

```bash
cd packages/core/gut
node -e "
const AzureAI = require('./azure-ai-integration.js');
const ai = new AzureAI();
console.log('Azure AI integration test complete');
"
```

## Step 4: Balanced Data Processing Guidelines

### No Censorship Policy
- All AI prompts allow full creative expression
- No content restrictions on visionary or metaphysical themes
- Encourage uncensored artistic freedom

### User Consent
- Always obtain explicit consent before processing personal data
- Provide clear opt-out options
- Explain AI enhancements transparently

### Ephemeral Processing
- Process data in real-time without permanent storage
- Delete temporary files immediately after use
- Ensure no user data persists beyond the session

### Ethical AI Usage
- AI enhances human creativity, never overrides it
- Maintain trauma-safe defaults
- Adapt to user emotional states

## Troubleshooting
- **Invalid Key**: Verify API keys in Azure Portal
- **Endpoint Errors**: Check region and resource names
- **Rate Limits**: Monitor Azure usage and upgrade if needed

## Cost Management
- Use Azure credits efficiently
- Monitor usage in Azure Cost Management
- Set up budgets and alerts for spending

This setup enables advanced AI features for art generation, game mechanics, and mystical analysis while maintaining ethical standards.
