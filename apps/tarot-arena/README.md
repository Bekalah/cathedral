# Tarot Arena

A mini-game where Arcana avatars (not just cards) interact, team up, duel, and create living art and patterns. Includes lore, grimoire, and user-generated egregores.

## Features
- Play as any Major Arcana avatar (egregore/character)
- Tarot "readings" as dynamic team-ups, duels, or artful patterns
- Each avatar has lore, stats, resonance, and unique powers
- Grimoire: built-in lore, and user can add their own
- Living art: avatars create patterns, music, or effects when combined
- ND/trauma-safe, consent-based, and creative

## Usage
1. `pnpm install`
2. `pnpm --filter @cathedral/tarot-arena dev`
3. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser

## Roadmap
- Expand avatar roster and lore
- Add more art/music/puzzle fusion modes
- Enable user-generated egregores and custom grimoires
- Integrate with other Cathedral modules (alchemy, labs, etc.)
