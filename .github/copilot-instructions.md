- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created.

- [x] Clarify Project Requirements (Python modular design suite + Achad system; headless rendering; cross-platform JSON export for Godot/JS)

- [x] Scaffold the Project (Created modular package in `design-suite/design_suite/*` with geometry, fractals, render, templates, CLI)

- [x] Customize the Project (Added Frater Achad system and integration bridge mapping pathways â†’ palettes/geometry/fractals)

- [x] Install Required Extensions (None required by setup tool; skipping per rules)

- [x] Compile the Project (Validated via smoketests; images render; exports OK)

- [x] Create and Run Task (Added VS Code task "validate: design suite"; runs both smoketests successfully)

- [x] Launch the Project (Runnable CLIs: `design-suite/cathedral_design_suite.py` and `hall-of-mysteries/frater_achad_system.py`; optional debug on request)

- [x] Ensure Documentation is Complete (Updated root `README.md` with Python suite quick-start; no HTML comments remain here)

- Work through each checklist item systematically.
- Keep communication concise and focused.
- Follow development best practices.
