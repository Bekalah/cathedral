## 🎨 DAVINCI-LEVEL DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### 1. Artistic Integration (Like Leonardo's Masterpieces)

```rust
// cathedral-design/da-vinci-principles.rs

pub struct DaVinciDesignSystem {
    // Leonardo's principles applied to digital design
    artistic_integration: ArtisticIntegrationEngine,
    engineering_excellence: EngineeringExcellenceSystem,
    universal_harmony: UniversalHarmonyEngine,
    innovative_functionality: InnovativeFunctionalitySystem,
    timeless_wisdom: TimelessWisdomIntegration,
}

impl DaVinciDesignSystem {
    pub fn apply_da_vinci_principles(&self) -> DaVinciDesignResult {
        // 1. Artistic Integration
        let artistic_design = self.artistic_integration.create_harmonious_interface();
        
        // 2. Engineering Excellence  
        let engineering_design = self.engineering_excellence.create_perfect_function();
        
        // 3. Universal Harmony
        let universal_design = self.universal_harmony.create_seamless_integration();
        
        // 4. Innovative Functionality
        let innovative_design = self.innovative_functionality.create_breakthrough_features();
        
        // 5. Timeless Wisdom
        let wisdom_design = self.timeless_wisdom.create_enduring_value();
        
        DaVinciDesignResult::new(
            artistic_design,
            engineering_design, 
            universal_design,
            innovative_design,
            wisdom_design,
        )
    }
}
```

### 2. Renaissance Engineering (Performance Meets Art)

```rust
// cathedral-engineering/renaissance-engineering.rs

pub struct RenaissanceEngineeringSystem {
    // Leonardo's engineering principles applied
    structural_beauty: StructuralBeautyEngine,
    functional_elegance: FunctionalEleganceSystem,
    proportion_perfection: ProportionPerfectionEngine,
    innovation_integration: InnovationIntegrationSystem,
}

impl RenaissanceEngineeringSystem {
    pub fn design_cathedral_interface(&self) -> CathedralInterfaceDesign {
        // Apply golden ratio proportions (1.618033988749895)
        let golden_proportions = self.calculate_golden_ratio_layout();
        
        // Create structural beauty with functional elegance
        let interface_structure = self.structural_beauty.create_interface_structure();
        let functional_elements = self.functional_elegance.create_functional_elements();
        
        // Perfect proportions throughout
        let proportioned_interface = self.proportion_perfection.apply_proportions(
            &interface_structure,
            &golden_proportions
        );
        
        CathedralInterfaceDesign {
            artistic_beauty: proportioned_interface,
            functional_elegance: functional_elements,
            golden_ratio_compliance: true,
