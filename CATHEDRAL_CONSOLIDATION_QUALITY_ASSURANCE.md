# 🏛️ Cathedral Consolidation & Quality Assurance

## Current Status
- **Main Repository**: `/Users/rebeccalemke/cathedral` (primary)
- **Backup Repository**: `/Users/rebeccalemke/cathedral-1` (backup clone)
- **Status**: Need to consolidate and ensure all systems work together

## 🎯 Consolidation Goals

### 1. Repository Structure Cleanup
```
✅ Main cathedral/ repository (primary)
❌ cathedral-1/ repository (backup - can be removed after consolidation)
✅ All systems in one place
✅ Clean package structure
✅ Working monorepo configuration
```

### 2. System Integration Verification
```
✅ Codex 144:99 Library (@cathedral/codex-library)
✅ Liber Arcanae System (@cathedral/liber-arcanae)
✅ Fusion Kink Engine (integrated in liber-arcanae)
✅ Design Library (@cathedral/design-library)
✅ Plugin System (@cathedral/plugin-system)
✅ All systems working together or independently
```

### 3. App Structure Optimization
```
📱 3 Main Apps + 2 New Apps:
✅ 1. Cathedral Connection Map (Piano Interface)
✅ 2. Cosmogenesis Visualizer (Sacred World Builder)
✅ 3. Master Catalog Browser (Spiritual Resources)
🆕 4. Liber Arcanae Tarot (Real Readings App)
🆕 5. Cathedral Design Studio (Figma-style Design Tool)
✅ All apps work standalone or as integrated system
```
