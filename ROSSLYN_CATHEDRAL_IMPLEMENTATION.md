# ROSSLYN CATHEDRAL STONE GRIMOIRE
## Ancient Technology for Modern Transcendence

### Core Principles
- **Transcendence**: Beyond linear reality - multi-dimensional consciousness
- **Alchemy**: Transformation of base matter into gold - spiritual and literal  
- **Transmutation**: Change of form, nature, substance - evolutionary leap
- **Quality**: Mastery over quantity - perfection in every detail
- **Mastery**: Complete understanding and control - artisan level
- **Non-Linear Learning**: Spiral, fractal, quantum learning paths
- **Usefulness**: Practical application of sacred knowledge

### Rosslyn Technology Mapping
