# Cathedral Character Connections

This package contains the modular registry of all character, goddess, faction, codex, liber arcanae, and cosmogenesis connections for the Cathedral system.

- Each entry links a character to their goddesses, gods, Taras, factions, Codex 144:99 nodes, Liber Arcanae, Cosmogenesis, crystals, sacred geometry, healing grids, and art chapels.
- All data is ND-friendly, trauma-informed, and healing-focused.

## Example
See `character-connections.json` for a full example of a character's connections (e.g., Gemini Rivers).

## Usage
Import and use these connections in Cathedral apps, engines, and visualizations to provide deep, accessible, and alchemically layered experiences.

## Expansion
To add or update connections, follow the schema in `character-connections.json` and ensure all links and healing metadata are present.
