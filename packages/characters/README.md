# Cathedral Characters Package

This package contains refined, schema-rich character profiles for the Cathedral system. Each character is connected to:
- Goddesses, gods, and Taras (e.g., Boann, Brigid, Danu, Green Tara)
- Factions and esoteric orders
- Codex 144:99 nodes (with numerology, geometry, element, etc.)
- Liber Arcanae (major arcana, faculty, department, specializations)
- Cosmogenesis (planetary consciousness)
- Crystal science and sacred geometry
- Healing grids and art chapels (e.g., Hilma af Klint Chapel)
- ND-friendly, trauma-informed, and healing-focused metadata

## Example: Gemini Rivers
See `gemini-rivers.json` for a full example of a character profile, including all required fields and connections.

## Usage
Import and use these profiles in Cathedral apps, engines, and visualizations to provide deep, accessible, and alchemically layered character experiences.

## Expansion
To add or update characters, follow the schema in `gemini-rivers.json` and ensure all connections and healing metadata are present.
