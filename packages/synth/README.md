# Cathedral Synth Lab

High-fidelity modular audio synthesis + narrative-integrated signal engine.

Design Goals:
- Realistic modular lab: oscillators, filters, distortion, granular, spectral sculpting
- Character-bound patches (avatar archetype → timbre signature)
- Crystal & archetype resonance mapping → modulation matrix
- Procedural performance scenes (Night Drive 4 / darkwave / Tool polyrhythms / NIN texture layering)
- Trauma-safe listening modes (dynamic loudness, safe spectral gating)
