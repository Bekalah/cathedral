# Cathedral Alchemy Layers

This package defines the esoteric, alchemical layers used throughout the Cathedral system. Each layer (Gold, Silver, Copper, Mercury, Salt, Tetragrammatron) is mapped to:
- Archetypes (major arcana, characters, suits)
- Crystals and minerals
- Sacred geometry forms
- Healing functions and esoteric domains

## Example Layer
```
{
  "name": "Gold",
  "domain": "Solar illumination, genius, creative will",
  "associated_archetypes": ["The Sun", "The Magician", "The World"],
  "crystals": ["Citrine", "Sunstone"],
  "geometry": ["Dodecagon", "Golden Rectangle"],
  "healing_function": "Illumination, manifestation, creative power"
}
```

## Usage
Import and use these layers to create real alchemical, spellbook, and crystal grid experiences in Cathedral apps and visualizations.

## Expansion
To add or update layers, follow the schema in `layers.json` and ensure all connections and healing metadata are present.
