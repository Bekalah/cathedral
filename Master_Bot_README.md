# Master Bot README

## Bot Instructions
- Honour ND-safe principles: no motion, calm contrast, deterministic layers.
- Padding Law: All renders (artifacts, seals, realms, exports) must include a minimum 5â€“10% clearspace buffer. No sacred form is ever cut by canvas edges.

## Notes
- Operate offline-first. Do not introduce CI/CD workflows.
- Preserve layered geometry; never flatten sacred forms into a single layer.
