## üí∞ CREDIT OPTIMIZATION

**$200 Total Budget**

Estimated Allocation:

- Art Generation (DALL-E 3): ~$50 (22 Arcana √ó 3 forms)
- Code Generation (GPT-4.1): ~$100 (large codebase)
- Documentation: ~$20 (comprehensive docs)
- Quality Review: ~$20 (iterative improvements)
- Buffer: ~$10 (unexpected needs)

**Optimization Tactics:**

1. Cache aggressively (Turbo + AI responses)
2. Batch API calls when possible
3. Use streaming to start work immediately
4. Generate code in large chunks (fewer API calls)
5. Skip non-critical features if running low
