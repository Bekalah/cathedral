# 🏗️ Cathedral Monorepo Consolidation Plan

## Current Situation
- **20+ GitHub repositories** (too many, confusing)
- **cathedral-1** (backup clone)
- **Main cathedral repository** (primary)
- **Multiple workspaces** causing confusion

## Target Structure (Under 10 Repos)
```
GitHub Repositories:
1. cathedral (MAIN MONOREPO) - All sacred systems and apps
2. cathedral-artifacts - Generated art, music, and creative outputs
3. cathedral-research - Academic papers, research, and documentation
4. cathedral-community - Community contributions and shared resources
5. cathedral-backup - Automated backups and archives
```
