— CATHEDRAL INTEGRITY ADDENDUM (NO PLACEHOLDERS) —

All contributors and code-bots must obey:

1) Canon-first: Only commit real canon. If data is not ready, do nothing. Do not invent, scaffold, or “mock”.
2) Append-only: Codex 144:99 is append-only. No overwrites, no renames of canon IDs.
3) No placeholders: The Cathedral forbids the introduction of placeholder text, fake datasets, empty meshes, bogus pigments, or “example” records. If you lack a real value, omit the field entirely.
4) Layer law (many layers preserved):
   • Number → Formula → Geometry → Pigment → Material → Harmonics → Motion → Annex (Lineage/Archetype) → Export (SVG+JSON+Checksums)
   • Each node plate is circular/oval; domed depth; ND-safe; deterministic; museum-grade export.
5) Deferral protocol: If a feature depends on missing canon, implement the interface and return a clear “awaiting canon” message in the UI (no fallback art), then stop. Never draw filler visuals. Never write placeholder JSON.
6) Provenance: Every export in research.json must include original formula + resolved parameters + ORCID + checksums.
7) Spatial vow: All primary canvases are ovals/vesicas/mandorlas with generous margins; no rectangular primary canvases.
8) Safety: No autoplay. Motion/audio only if body.allow-motion. No strobe. Contrast ≥ 4.5:1. Calm/Stop always available.
9) Placement: Only write to Brain (apps/cosmogenesis), Body (apps/stone-grimoire), Soul (apps/liber-arcanae), Shared (packages/codex-14499). If unsure, write nothing; or stage to _staging/ for human triage.
10) Gate: Before commit, run `node scripts/no-placeholders.mjs`. Commits must pass the gate.

This addendum guards the Cathedral’s many-layer plan. No shortcuts, no fake scaffolds. Only living canon.
