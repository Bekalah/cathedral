# 🏗️ Cathedral Monorepo Consolidation & Enhancement Project

## 🎯 Phase 1: Repository Consolidation
- [ ] Audit all external repositories and identify candidates for consolidation
- [ ] Identify duplicate packages and merge conflicting implementations
- [ ] Clean up root-level HTML files and consolidate into proper apps
- [ ] Move external/ components into packages/
- [ ] Update GitHub repository structure across all repos

## 📦 Phase 2: Core Systems Consolidation
- [x] Create unified `@cathedral/codex-144-99` package (merge external/codex-144-99 + packages/codex-144 + packages/codex-14499 + packages/codex-library)
- [x] Create unified `@cathedral/liber-arcanae` package (merge external/liber-arcanae + packages/liber-arcanae)
- [x] Create unified `@cathedral/fusion-kink-engine` with 144-node Codex and Violet Flame integration
- [ ] Consolidate design libraries (packages/cathedral-design-library + packages/design-library)
- [ ] Clean up duplicate brain/art/sound/creative systems

## 🎮 Phase 3: App Structure Optimization
- [ ] Consolidate 9 apps into 4-5 core apps as per monorepo plan
- [ ] Redirect cathedral-connection-map, cosmogenesis-visualizer, master-catalog-browser
- [ ] Enhance liber-arcanae-tarot as real readings app with Circuitum99 spreads
- [ ] Upgrade cathedral-design-studio to full Figma-style tool
- [ ] Ensure each app can run standalone or integrated

## 🌀 Phase 4: System Enhancement (Production-Ready Features)
- [ ] Perfect Codex 144:99 nodes with quantum fractal mathematics and cosmic resonances
- [ ] Expand Liber Arcanae Codex Abyssiae with complete 144-node quantum links and shadow integration
- [ ] Enhance Fusion Kink engine with professional therapeutic protocols and safety accreditation
- [ ] Integrate market-competitive art/sound/creative generation systems with ML models
- [ ] Implement advanced maps and guildes system with interactive codex visualization
- [ ] Add comprehensive symbolic libraries (Kabbalah, Hermetics, Alchemy, Astrology)
- [ ] Implement research integration with academic databases and real-time sources
- [ ] Add professional-quality tarot reading engine with accredited interpretations
- [ ] Create enterprise-grade design studio with Figma/GIMP-level capabilities
- [ ] Build production-ready API for direct commercial applications

## 🌙 Phase 5: Violet Flame Transmutation
- [ ] Implement save/share system for enhanced codex transformations
- [ ] Add violet flame transmutation feature to generate different results
- [ ] Create repository transmutation system for flexible architectures
- [ ] Implement consciousness transformation mechanics

## 🔧 Phase 6: Quality Assurance & Deployment
- [ ] Update turbo configuration for optimized build pipeline
- [ ] Implement ownership validation and data integrity checks
- [ ] Update all cross-references and dependencies
- [ ] Prepare repositories for the violet flame of transmutation
