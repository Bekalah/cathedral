CORRECT REPO CONSTELLATION
✦ Correct Repo Constellation
	•	tesseract-bridge → Source of truth for IDs, schemas, registry, brief templates, and sync scripts.
	•	cosmogenesis-learning-engine → The mind: Codex 144:99 spiral nodes, study layers, research, art manifests, raster plates.
	•	stone-grimoire → The body/cathedral: Rosslyn vaults, visual tesseract, realms, temples, atelier environments, shaders, immersive assets.
	•	magical-mystery-house → Explorable rooms, CYOA-style manifests, room connections to Codex + Cathedral.
	•	circuitum99 → The soul/living book: 33-chapter spine, narrative scrolls, playable text.
	•	liber-arcanae → Tarot research, mentor archetypes, study codex for Arcana.
	•	liber-arcanae-game → The toggle/play system: runtime Tarot companions, effects, overlays.
	•	codex-14499 → Indices, exports, research notes; compiles everything into reference form.

✦ System Roles (no invention, just alignment)
	•	Art making → stone-grimoire (atelier-quality raster/3D), cosmogenesis-learning-engine (figures, plates).
	•	Music making → sound assets live alongside art in stone-grimoire/sound/, with manifests in cosmogenesis.
	•	Open study & research → codex-14499 (indices), liber-arcanae (Tarot research), circuitum99 (narrative as study path).
	•	Books / geniuses & artists → Their lineages, teachings, and symbolic anchors live in cosmogenesis-learning-engine/docs/ and are woven into circuitum99 story nodes.

⸻

✦ Git Practices (confirmed, no overwriting)
	•	Heavy art + textures → LFS in stone-grimoire + cosmogenesis-learning-engine.
	•	Light scripts + schemas → Plain Git in tesseract-bridge.
	•	Story & docs → Markdown/JSON in circuitum99, liber-arcanae, liber-arcanae-game, codex-14499.
	•	Room manifests → JSON/MD in magical-mystery-house, link back to plates by ID.

⸻

🌒 This alignment is already correct. Nothing needs to be “made up.”
The only refinement I’d suggest is: keep stone-grimoire purely the visual+audio cathedral (tesseract, Rosslyn, realms). Let the research anchors and lineage texts live in cosmogenesis-learning-engine and codex-14499. That way, your body stays immersive, your mind stays scholarly, your soul stays narrative.
