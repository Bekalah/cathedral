## Overview
The OpenSpec Master Opus is a "Hermetic RPG + Creative Workstation" designed to be an interactive experience continuing the Western Mystery Tradition. Users play as 22 Major Arcana characters, each teaching real occult systems through gameplay. The project aims for a seamless transition between Game Mode, Design Mode (for creating with hermetic symbols), and Music Mode (for composing with angel frequencies). The project's ambition is to create a "museum-quality visionary art" experience, drawing inspiration from works like Jung's Red Book, The Matrix, American Gods, The Witcher, and Fable, with a focus on photorealistic Renaissance/Baroque art, Gothic cathedral architecture, and authentic mystical systems. It functions as a "Cathedral University" where the 22 Major Arcana are faculty members teaching courses on mystical and scientific knowledge.

## User Preferences
### Communication Style
- User wants authentic, photorealistic, immersive design.
- NO flat/cartoony/square UI elements.
- User has extensive documentation in repository notes.
- User values real historical mysticism + modern physics/science.
- Appreciates Renaissance/Baroque classical art aesthetics.

### Development Priorities
1. Photorealistic visual quality above all else.
2. Use actual repository JSON datasets (don't mock data).
3. Authentic grimoire systems and Thelemic mechanics.
4. Gothic cathedral immersion like Rosslyn Chapel.
5. Real Web Audio synthesizers with cathedral acoustics.

### General Working Preferences
- **NEVER** use flat UI buttons or panels for the main experience.
- **ALWAYS** match user's photorealistic art standards.
- **ALWAYS** use actual repository datasets (TAROT_MASTER_DATASET.json, nodes.json).
- **REMEMBER** this is a cathedral university with 22 faculty teaching real courses.
- **REMEMBER** each Major Arcana has specific Hz frequency, Merkaba chariot, and powers.
- This is an **educational tool** for learning mystic and scientific knowledge in an immersive way.

## System Architecture
The project is built as a multi-platform system integrating a Godot game engine, a Rust bridge library, and a React control console.

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Art Style:** Photorealistic Renaissance/Baroque, NOT flat, cartoony, or square UI.
- **Architecture:** Gothic cathedral architecture, inspired by Rosslyn Chapel, featuring vaulted arches, stone pillars, stained glass, and geometric floor patterns.
- **Visual Elements:** 3D physical sacred geometry (Merkaba stars, Double helix DNA, Metatron's Cube) with depth, glow, and volumetric bloom.
- **Character Portraits:** Photorealistic faces with period clothing, intricate details, and glowing cyan sacred geometry sigils.
- **Color Science:** Deep blues, warm golds, and accent colors like cyan, magenta, purple, and emerald, against dark atmospheric backgrounds with high contrast glowing elements.
- **Typography:** Classical serif fonts with gold gilding, echoing a physical tarot card aesthetic.
- **OpenSpec Palette:** Utilizes a specific visionary art color palette: Obsidian (#0d0b12), Alchemical Gold (#f4d03f), Rose Quartz (#ff9fbe), Teal Glow (#6de0e0), and Vesica (#8a7fff).

### Technical Implementations & Features
- **Godot Cathedral:** The primary game environment for 3D exploration, 22 Major Arcana character selection, and a Thelemic alignment system. Supports Game, Design, and Music modes.
- **Rust Bridge (cathedral-core):** A high-performance library bridging Godot and canonical data sources. It loads JSON datasets, exposes a GDNative API to Godot, implements "Fusion Kink" sacred ratios (144 √∑ 99 = 1.454545), and handles angel/demon correspondence and harmonic frequency calculations.
- **React Console (web-platform):** A control console for orchestration, visual analytics of Codex 144:99 data, mode selection, and engine management.
- **Codex 144:99 System:** Defines 144 Manifestation Nodes (Light/Angel) and 99 Dissolution Gates (Shadow/Demon), with a "Fusion Kink" ratio. It includes 33 chapters for pathworking, 22 Major Arcana (playable characters with associated angels, demons, frequencies, colors, Merkaba chariots, and powers), and 72 Shem Angels. It organizes knowledge into Seven Ribbons: SCIENCE, CANNON, PSYCH, CRAFT, ESOTERIC, RESEARCH, and FUSION.
- **RPG Mechanics:** 22 Major Arcana act as faculty members teaching courses, each with a Merkaba chariot, department, powers, and resonant frequency.
- **Music:** Integration of 10 legendary synthesizers via Web Audio API.
- **Gameplay:** Fable-like gameplay with Thelemic pathworking, a Double Tree of Life navigation system, Merkaba chariot builders, and interactive grimoire spell learning.

### System Design Choices
- **Monorepo Structure:** Consolidates multiple previous repositories into a single system for better management.
- **Data-Driven:** Heavily relies on canonical JSON datasets like `TAROT_MASTER_DATASET.json` and `circuitum99-nodes.json`.
- **Seamless Mode Switching:** Allows fluid transitions between Game, Design, and Music modes.
- **Photorealistic Rendering:** Utilizes Godot 4.4 with Forward+ renderer and post-processing effects like bloom and vignette.

## External Dependencies
- **Godot Engine:** Primary game engine for the interactive experience.
- **Rust:** Used for the high-performance `cathedral-core` bridge library.
- **React:** Powers the `web-platform` control console.
- **Vite:** Build tool for the React frontend.
- **React Three Fiber:** For 3D rendering within the React console.
- **GDNative:** Godot's native extension interface for the Rust bridge.
- **Serde JSON:** Rust library for JSON serialization/deserialization.
- **Web Audio API:** For implementing legendary synthesizers and audio composition.
- **JSON Data Files:** `TAROT_MASTER_DATASET.json` (22 Major Arcana specs), `circuitum99-nodes.json` (144 nodes), and `openspec-palette.json` (color definitions).
