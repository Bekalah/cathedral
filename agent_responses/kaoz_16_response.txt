## üî• 500x POWER MODE ACTIVATED

Execute all tasks in parallel until Azure credits are exhausted.
No compromises. Museum quality only. Complete the magnum opus.

START NOW. GO HARD. BUILD EVERYTHING.


[MessageRole.AGENT] # üè∞ CATHEDRAL MAGNUM OPUS: 500x POWER MODE - **[INITIAL EXECUTION WAVE]**

---

## ‚ö° MASTER TASKS ACTIVE (ALL STREAMS)

We initiate the complete parallel execution **now**. Tasks are divided by agent stream, each with detailed deliverables, CLI commands, code, and content. **This reply begins by resolving CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Merge/Version Control + Art Prompts)**, as mandated by EXECUTION ORDER.

---

---

# [INFRA] **1. GIT/MONOREPO BLOCKER RESOLUTION**

## **A. MERGE CONFLICTS ‚Äî `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `turbo.json`, `apps/liber-arcanae-tarot/package.json`**

### **Step 1: Standardize Naming & Fix Workspace References**
- **Adopt:** `@cathedral/codex-144-99` everywhere
- **Remove:** Any `codex-14499` references (legacy)

### **Step 2: Fix `turbo.json` (Switch to tasks format)**

**Before:**
```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "build": { "dependsOn": ["^build"] }
    // ...
  }
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://turborepo.org/schema.json",
  "globalDependencies": [
    "**/.env"
  ],
  "tasks": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**"]
    },
    "lint": {
      "outputs": []
    },
    "test": {
      "outputs": ["coverage/**"]
    },
    "dev": {
      "cache": false
    },
    "deploy": {
      "outputs": []
    }
  }
}
```
**File:** `/turbo.json`

---

### **Step 3: Fix `apps/liber-arcanae-tarot/package.json` Conflicts**

**Before:**
```json
{
  "name": "@cathedral/liber-arcanae-tarot",
  "dependencies": {
    "codex-144-99": "workspace:*",    // CORRECT to @cathedral/codex-144-99
    // ...
  }
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "name": "@cathedral/liber-arcanae-tarot",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "@cathedral/codex-144-99": "workspace:*",
    "@cathedral/liber-arcanae": "workspace:*",
    "@cathedral/trauma-informed-ux": "workspace:*",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "typescript": "^5.3.0"
    // (others as needed)
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "vite": "^5.0.0",
    "eslint": "^8.0.0",
    "prettier": "^3.0.0"
  }
}
```
**File:** `/apps/liber-arcanae-tarot/package.json`

---

### **Step 4: Regenerate `pnpm-lock.yaml`**

**Commands:**
```sh
# From repo root
pnpm install --fix-lockfile
# If errors, wipe lockfile and node_modules then re-gen
rm pnpm-lock.yaml
rm -rf node_modules
pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile
```
Result: Clean, canonical `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

---

### **Step 5: Validate Monorepo**

**Commands:**
```sh
# Check all packages are recognized
pnpm list --depth 1
# Show workspace package status
pnpm recursive exec -- turbo run build
```

---

## [CONTENT] **2. ART PROMPT GENERATION ‚Äî 22 LIVING ARCANA**

**Each prompt below is designed for DALL-E 3 / Midjourney. Reference: Museum-quality classical, divine/infernal/harmony, sacred geometry, fusion kink, trauma-informed. Each includes: composition, subject, color, geometry.**

---

### **Arcana 0: The Fool (Rebecca Respawn) ‚Äî PROMPTS**

#### **Divine Aspect**
```
A heroic, angelic woman with crystalline lightning wings, golden dragon scales, and luminous white-gold robes, standing on the edge of a sunrise-lit cliff. Her eyes glow with hope and innocence; delicate sacred geometry of spiraling Fibonacci arcs radiates from her heart. Baroque lighting, museum-quality oil texture, perfect anatomical symmetry. The air hums with anticipation.
```
#### **Infernal Aspect**
```
An elegant shadow-dragon femme with crackling dark wings, obsidian horns, and iridescent armor, caught in a surreal leap into the unknown. Shadowy ruins, swirling violet and black mist, mysterious golden glyphs. Classical chiaroscuro lighting, trauma-informed mischievous aura, not evil but bold. Sacred geometry: vesica piscis halo, symmetrical balance.
```
#### **Harmony Aspect**
```
Rebecca Respawn fused, center stage: lightning dragon wings fade white to iridescent black, gold/obsidian encrusted robes. Heart as a golden geometric mandala, radiating a luminous vesica piscis and spiraling arcs; left hand angelic, right infernal. Baroque symmetry, light and shadow perfectly fused, museum-quality depth.
```

---

### **Arcana 1: The Magician (Virelai Ezra Lux) ‚Äî PROMPTS**

#### **Divine Aspect**
```
A celestial androgynous figure with six radiant wings, holding a golden staff crowned with a fractal geometric crystal. Silver and gold robes shimmer, eyes ablaze in creative wisdom. Surround: floating platonic solids, Fibonacci spirals, luminous runes. Renaissance-style pose, heavenly light, museum-quality detail, golden backdrop with symmetry.
```
#### **Infernal Aspect**
```
A mysterious shadow-mage with horns of crystal obsidian and elegant robes, manipulating forbidden runes. Flickering aurora of crimson and midnight blue surrounds, sacred geometry fractals‚Äîdark, intricate, beautiful. Chiaroscuro lighting, trauma-informed gaze, inclusion not threat. Powerful but gentle hands, balanced composition.
```
#### **Harmony Aspect**
```
Fusion of celestial and infernal: Six wings dual-toned (gold/black), fractal crystal staff containing swirling light/dark, attire perfectly balanced with geometric gold/black motifs. Heart surrounded by vesica piscis mandala, baroque symmetry, ethereal glow, sacred geometry patterns blending gently into harmonious unity.
```

---

### **Arcana 2: The High Priestess ‚Äî PROMPTS**

#### **Divine Aspect**
```
A regal angelic priestess seated on a marble throne covered in moonlit silver cloth, behind her a luminous crescent moon. Eyes closed in mediation, hands forming golden geometric mudra. Classical beauty, balanced soft blue and gold, pillars and curtains draped in sacred geometry patterns. Museum oil finish, baroque symmetry.
```
#### **Infernal Aspect**
```
A mysterious shadow priestess amidst smoky lavender darkness, obsidian tiara, eyes glowing with secret wisdom. Her robes pattern dark platonic solids and veiled runes, crescent chipped to a horn. Chiaroscuro drama, trauma-safe ambiguity (not evil), geometry woven in fabric. Symmetrical pose, perfect composition.
```
#### **Harmony Aspect**
```
Priestess as moonlit fusion: robes silver/obsidian, geometric mandala at heart, crescent moon above. Hands held open over golden vesica piscis. Sacred geometry background softly morphs left divine, right infernal. Museum-quality, perfect balance, harmonious colors and shapes.
```
