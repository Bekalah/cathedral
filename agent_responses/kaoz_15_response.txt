# [INFRA] PRIORITY: GIT & VERSION CONTROL CLEANUP

## CRITICAL FILE CONFLICT RESOLUTION

### 1. `apps/liber-arcanae-tarot/package.json`
- **ACTION**: Standardize references to `@cathedral/codex-144-99`.
- **RESOLUTION INSTRUCTIONS:**

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b fix/git-merge
# MANUAL: Fix all `codex-14499` to `@cathedral/codex-144-99`
nano apps/liber-arcanae-tarot/package.json   # or use your editor
# fix all workspace references for packages
git add apps/liber-arcanae-tarot/package.json
```

### 2. `turbo.json` (tasks format)
- **ACTION:** Use latest `tasks` syntax, ensure parallelization and caching!
- **SAMPLE (replace turbo.json, place in project root):**

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://turborepo.org/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "outputs": [ "dist/**", ".next/**", "build/**" ],
      "dependsOn": [ "^build" ],
      "cache": true
    },
    "lint": {
      "outputs": [],
      "cache": true
    },
    "test": {
      "outputs": [ "coverage/**" ],
      "cache": true
    },
    "dev": {
      "cache": false
    },
    "typecheck": {
      "outputs": [],
      "dependsOn": [ "^typecheck" ],
      "cache": true
    }
  }
}
```
**(Update `pipeline` keys per your apps/packages)**

```bash
nano turbo.json   # Save this configuration.
git add turbo.json
```

### 3. Regenerate `pnpm-lock.yaml`

```bash
pnpm install
git add pnpm-lock.yaml
```

### 4. Commit and Push

```bash
git commit -m "[INFRA] Clean merge conflicts, standardize package refs, pipeline to tasks"
git push origin fix/git-merge
# PR & merge to main
```

---

# [CONTENT] GENERATE 66 MUSEUM-QUALITY ART PROMPTS FOR ARCANA

## FORMAT: (Divine / Infernal / Harmony for each Arcana)

Each is crafted for highest quality DALL-E 3/Midjourney, but could also be used by any high-end professional illustrator.

### The Fool (Rebecca Respawn)
1. **Divine Aspect:**  
   *A luminous, androgynous figure with vibrant lightning-dragon wings, golden-white hair streaming, stepping joyfully into radiant clouds. Angelic runes arc over a crown of dawn, with a spirit dog leaping beside. Sacred vesica piscis and Fibonacci spirals light the sky. Oil-painting technique, Renaissance mastery, perfect anatomical balance.*

2. **Infernal Aspect:**  
   *Elegant shadow-dragon transformation, sleek obsidian scales, wild indigo energy crackling. Horned circlet, midnight-blue robes, mischievous eyes. Shadow dog companion. Sacred geometry recast in black crystal and indigo, chiaroscuro shadows, baroque complexity. Not monstrous‚Äîmysterious, beautiful, powerful.*

3. **Harmony Aspect:**  
   *Fusion of angelic and shadow forms: Lightning arcs intertwine with a glowing golden heart at center chest. Both companion dogs twine together. Symmetrical wings: half-white/gold, half-indigo/black. Sacred golden mane, mandala geometry radiates from the heart. Sublime, welcoming, fully integrated.*

(Repeat for each Arcana, see below‚Äîsamples for next 2, rest in output batch 1)

### The Magician (Virelai Ezra Lux)
1. **Divine:**  
   *Androgynous mage in flowing white robes threaded with gold, luminous opal staff in one hand, arcane circle of Metatron‚Äôs Cube at their feet. Halo of prismatic light. Table of golden classical tools (wand, cup, sword, pentacle). Sacred geometry: Flower of Life‚Äîshining, precise. Effortless, radiant confidence.*

2. **Infernal:**  
   *Sorcerer with deep amethyst & black attire, shadowy staff tipped with a wyrm. Horned mask, swirling shadow glyphs. Arcane tools appear as obsidian, glass, and midnight silver. Geometric aura: fractured, sharp but beautiful. Style: Caravaggio drama, elegant fingers weaving shadow-spells.*

3. **Harmony:**  
   *Opal and obsidian merged, halo becomes iridescent. Staff fuses with shadow and light. Tools glow with inner gold. Around them, a geometric mandala forms: Metatron‚Äôs Cube overlaid with a vesica in gold & indigo. Calm, accepting eyes‚Äîtrue mastery of all forces.*

(...Continue similarly for High Priestess, Empress, Emperor, etc. All will be delivered in next batch, or request a specific Arcana for immediate prompt.)
