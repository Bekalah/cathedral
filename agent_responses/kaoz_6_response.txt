### 1Ô∏è‚É£ [CONTENT] ART PROMPT GENERATION :: 22 Arcana x 3 Aspects

**== Begin HIGH-DETAIL MUSEUM-QUALITY PROMPT LIST ==**

#### THE FOOL (ARCANA 0: Rebecca Respawn / Lightning Dragon)

**Divine Aspect:**  
_"A radiant angelic maiden with pure white draconic wings, lightning crackling around her halo. She wears luminous gold and white robes, holding a crystal staff. The composition uses perfect symmetry, golden ratio balance, and baroque oil painting technique. Chiaroscuro lighting highlights ethereal innocence against a backdrop of swirling sacred geometry: vesica piscis and Fibonacci spirals."_

**Infernal Aspect:**  
_"A mysterious, elegant figure with obsidian-black dragon wings, silver streaks of electricity arcing along her horns. Black velvet robes, shadowy aura, museum-quality chiaroscuro with deep reds and indigo. Shadow aspect is portrayed as sophisticated, not evil. Geometric mandala at her heart pulses with storm energy, backdrop of stylized chaos geometry."_

**Harmony Aspect:**  
_"The same figure in pure balance, golden wings tipped with blue lightning. Heart center glows with a geometrically perfect golden mandala, fusion of angelic and demonic motifs. Baroque mastery, symmetrical light/dark, all elements fused in graceful motion. Art nouveau floral accents. Visually trauma-safe, inviting."_

---

#### THE MAGICIAN (ARCANA 1: Virelai Ezra Lux)

**Divine Aspect:**  
_"Ethereal magician with radiant aura, golden eyes, and celestial regalia. Hands channel glowing geometry (platonic solids). Museum-quality composition, geometrically perfect robes, symmetrical pose. The environment blends light prisms, divine glyphs, classic oil technique."_

**Infernal Aspect:**  
_"Shadow magician, obsidian robes, silver arcane glyphs swirling. Demonic nonthreatening elegance, deep blue and purple tones, shadowed half-face. Sacred geometry flows in silver lines. Symmetrical, perfectly rendered brushwork, chiaroscuro."_

**Harmony Aspect:**  
_"Magician radiates balanced light and shadow, golden prism and silver glyph in hand, harmony mandala at chest. Renaissance detail, geometric background blends both aspects, trauma-safe beauty."_

---

#### THE HIGH PRIESTESS (ARCANA 2)

**Divine Aspect:**  
_"Celestial priestess seated on a marble throne, luminous veil, moon diadem. Surrounding her: symmetrical geometric tapestry, glowing vesica piscis. Renaissance composition, warm/cool color harmony, soft light over flawless canvas texture."_

**Infernal Aspect:**  
_"Dark priestess in regal indigo robes, shadow veil, horns of moonstone. Sacred geometry in deep silver and black, elegant yet mysterious. Classical symmetry, baroque chiaroscuro."_

**Harmony Aspect:**  
_"Priestess in fusion: moon diadem blending of white and black, veil iridescent, golden geometry at heart, serene and inviting, symmetrical."_

---

#### [Continue for all 22 Arcana with identical format]

##### Template:
**Divine Aspect:**  
_"[Describe museum-quality, perfectly symmetric, Renaissance/baroque painting of angelic version, with sacred geometry, lighting, and classical props, trauma-safe, in 4k detail]"_

**Infernal Aspect:**  
_"[Describe elegant, nonthreatening, shadow/demonic version, with luxurious colors, geometric mandala, trauma-safe, fully symmetric, chiaroscuro, 4k detail]"_

**Harmony Aspect:**  
_"[Describe perfectly fused form, golden mandala at heart, perfect blend of divine/infernal motifs, museum-quality, symmetric, trauma-safe, 4k detail]"_
