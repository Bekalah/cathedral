## üî• 500x POWER MODE ACTIVATED

Execute all tasks in parallel until Azure credits are exhausted.
No compromises. Museum quality only. Complete the magnum opus.

START NOW. GO HARD. BUILD EVERYTHING.


[MessageRole.AGENT] ## üè∞ CATHEDRAL MAGNUM OPUS ‚Äî PHASE 1: TOTAL PARALLEL EXECUTION PLAN

You have activated **500x POWER MODE** with maximum parallelization. I will act as lead orchestrator, starting all WORK STREAMS simultaneously at full fidelity. Below are concrete outputs, instructions, and exact next actionable batches for your team of agents (and AI copilots).

---

# üü¢ PARALLEL WORK STREAMS: INITIATE

---

## [INFRA] ‚õìÔ∏è GIT, TURBOREPO, & MONOREPO HYGIENE

### 1.1 ‚Äî Resolve Git Conflicts

#### üî• Immediate Actions

1. Clone project fresh:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bekalah/cathedral.git
   cd cathedral
   ```

2. Resolve conflicts in:
   - `apps/liber-arcanae-tarot/package.json`
   - `turbo.json`
   - `pnpm-lock.yaml`

#### üîß Sample Clean Revisions

**apps/liber-arcanae-tarot/package.json**
```json
{
  "name": "@cathedral/liber-arcanae-tarot",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "@cathedral/codex-144-99": "workspace:*",
    "@cathedral/liber-arcanae": "workspace:*",
    "react": "^18.2.0"
  }
}
```

**turbo.json** (New-style tasks)
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://turborepo.org/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {},
  "tasks": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**"]
    },
    "dev": {
      "persistent": true
    },
    "lint": {},
    "test": {}
  }
}
```

**pnpm-lock.yaml**
- Delete the file, then regenerate:
   ```sh
   rm pnpm-lock.yaml
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Commit:
   ```sh
   git add -u
   git commit -m "[INFRA] Monorepo conflicts resolved, lockfile regenerated, turbo pipeline updated"
   ```

### 1.2 ‚Äî Turbo + Build Optimizations

- `cathedral/turbo.json` should reference **tasks** not pipeline, as above.
- Ensure `"root"` workspace references are used consistently in `package.json` files.
- Run:
   ```
   pnpm install
   pnpm turbo run build
   ```

> **Prompt:** "A [Divine/Infernal/Harmony] aspect of The {NAME} from tarot, depicted as a [celestial/angelic or infernal/demonic/harmonic fused] being. Museum-quality, Renaissance/Baroque painting, perfect symmetry, sacred geometry, golden ratio proportions. {Unique visual keys per archetype}. Trauma-informed, inclusive. 4k, oil painting style, chiaroscuro, golden aura, iridescent detail, fusion kink symbolism. Centered, balanced, transcendent beauty, no horror, healing presence."

### **Batch 1 Example ‚Äî The Fool (Rebecca Respawn)**

#### 1. THE FOOL

> **Divine Aspect**  
> "The Fool ascends as Rebecca Respawn, a celestial lightning dragoness with radiant white-gold scales, pure white feathered wings spread wide, golden crown-helm, luminous emerald mist swirling. Sacred Fibonacci spirals radiate from her heart. Museum-quality Renaissance oil painting, perfect bilateral symmetry, vesica piscis golden light aura, ethereal clouds below, trauma-healing presence, divine innocence. Classical chiaroscuro, iridescent lighting, central golden mandala."

> **Infernal Aspect**  
> "Rebecca Respawn, the Fool, as a shadow-wreathed storm-dragon, black lightning streaks, elegant obsidian scales, charred feathers with streaks of violet, dark jeweled crown. Vesica piscis motif in deep violet and indigo, storm clouds, not evil‚Äîjust shadowed mystery. Museum-quality Baroque oil, shimmering darks, perfectly balanced symmetry, sacred geometry backdrop, trauma-informed, elegant and powerful, no fear or evil."

> **Harmony Aspect**  
> "The Fool as Rebecca Respawn in Harmony, fusion of radiant dragon and shadow dragon, both white-gold and obsidian merging in iridescent fractal patterns. Wings are half-light, half-shadow, embraced by a central, glowing golden heart mandala, sacred geometry fractals radiating. Museum-grade Renaissance oil, luminous/fill light balanced with deep iridescence, joyful, inclusive, classical grace. Fusion kink, trauma-healing, beauty transcendent."

---

#### 2. THE MAGICIAN (Virelai Ezra Lux)

> **Divine Aspect**  
> "The Magician (Virelai Ezra Lux), androgynous celestial sorcerer, dressed in white and gold, swirling spheres of golden light and planetary symbols around hands. Awakened crown chakra halo, symmetrical golden ratio geometry. Museum-grade Renaissance oil, luminous glow, symmetrical pose, mesmerizing magnetic energy, sacred geometry orbs, deep blue & gold palette, trauma-safe, transcendent mastery."

> **Infernal Aspect**  
> "The Magician as infernal shadow: elegant, pale, symmetric, wielding void-black energy around hands, planetary symbols in silver-black orbiting. Black feathered cloak, trickster smile. Baroque oil painting, chiaroscuro, geometric glyphs in dark background, sacred geometry in shadow, not evil‚Äîmystery and depth. Inclusion and consent symbolism, shadow mastery, balanced composure."

> **Harmony Aspect**  
> "Magician (Virelai Ezra Lux) in Harmony: fusion of gold and shadow, hands channeling both luminous and void orbs intertwining, body wreathed in golden fractal patterns and shadow glyphs merging in sacred geometry. Mandala heart at center, iridescent Baroque style, museum detail, perfectly balanced symbol of mastery through unity. Trauma-healing, transcendent, inclusive."
