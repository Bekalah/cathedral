# 2. [CONTENT] 66 MUSEUM-QUALITY ART PROMPTS: 22 LIVING ARCANA (DIVINE, INFERNAL, HARMONY)

Below: Prompts for DALL-E 3, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion (copy-paste ready).
**Use for web/godot assets.**

---

## ARCANA 0: THE FOOL (‚ÄúRebecca Respawn‚Äù)

### Divine Aspect
`A radiant, androgynous figure leaping from a marble cliff, trailing wings of pure plasma lightning. Classical features illuminated by heavenly gold-white light, crowned by a geometric halo of concentric rings and Fibonacci spirals. Baroque robes ripple, revealing sacred tattoos. Sacred geometry arcs beneath ‚Äî golden vesica piscis, cube and dodecahedron patterns. Supreme confidence, divine potential, dawn sky behind, oil painting in the style of Bouguereau and Leonardo.`

### Infernal Aspect
`An elegant, youthful trickster with storm-grey skin and sharp, luminous blue eyes. Flayed lightning-dragon tail, infernal black wings tinged with iridescent indigo. Auric runes burning along arms, Baroque leather jacket over tattered tunic. Background storm of swirling shadow, fractal energy patterns, sacred geometry glowing with deep blue, gothic jewel tones. Masterpiece by John Blanche fused with Caravaggio.`

### Harmony Aspect
`Rebecca Respawn as a fusion of both divine and infernal forms, golden-dragon heart exposed in her chest, electrical plasma streaming between white and black wings. Golden ratio spirals intertwining through her body, both hands open in cosmic welcome. Lush, symmetrical composition, vesica piscis radiating from the heart, ancient stone arch framing a world of possibility. Oil + digital painting hybrid.`

---

## ARCANA 1: THE MAGICIAN (‚ÄúVirelai Ezra Lux‚Äù)

### Divine Aspect
`Celestial mage in mirror-polished golden armor, wielding a crystal rod topped with a double helix. Floating above a marble altar inscribed with mathematical runes and golden Fibonacci spirals. Eyes aglow with arcane light, four elemental orbs orbiting the air: fire, water, air, earth. Background of starlit cosmos stitched with luminous sacred geometry grids. Homage to Raphael, maximal classical beauty.`

### Infernal Aspect
`Charming alchemist, obsidian-horned, with serpentine iridescent tattoos. Hands weaving runes of violet fire above a shadow-forged table. Black velvet robes, threateningly elegant, cradling a cracked Philosopher's Stone. Chiaroscuro lighting, gothic cathedral interior with sacred geometry in negative space. Infused with Bosch and Giger aesthetics, dark yet magnetic.`

### Harmony Aspect
`The Magician mid-fusion, casting both light and shadow. Gold and indigo magic swirling in perfect spirals around a double halo. Vestments blending white and black, left and right hands each channeling a different polarity. Divine and infernal sigils intertwined across the floor in luminous harmony. Style: Renaissance-meets-Art Nouveau, absolute symmetry.`
