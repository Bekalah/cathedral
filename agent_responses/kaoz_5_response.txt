## [CONTENT] 2. ART PROMPT GENERATION: 22 LIVING ARCANA (66 TOTAL VARIANTS)

### Divine, Infernal, Harmony Forms (Museum-Quality Art Prompts)

**PROMPT FORMAT FOR DALL-E 3 / MIDJOURNEY:**
```
[Arcana Name]: {Elaborate character archetype description as divine/infernal/harmony aspect, following strict list below. Classic renaissance/baroque oil painting quality, perfect geometry, chiaroscuro mastery, fusion kink inclusivity, trauma-informed beauty, 4K details, symmetry, golden ratio composition, sacred geometry, fusion heart/mandala, luminous colors, elegant attire.}
```
---

### 2.1 (EXAMPLE: The Fool)

#### The Fool ‚Äî Rebecca Respawn (Lightning Dragon Transformation)

**Divine Form Prompt**
> The Fool, Rebecca Respawn as a lightning dragon angel. Portray a luminous woman with cascading silver robes, ethereal white wings spark with electric blue arcane energy. Halo shaped like a golden infinity loop, held aloft on fractal clouds beneath a radiant golden sky. Her eyes reflect childlike hope‚Äîa vesica piscis mandala glows from her heart. Sacred geometry patterns shimmer on her skin; the background fades to soft dawn. Museum-quality, Renaissance oil style.

**Infernal Form Prompt**
> The Fool, Rebecca Respawn as an elegant shadow dragon. Dark opalescent scales, black silken wings, curved silver horns, iridescent shadows swirling around her. Eyes flash with mischievous indigo light. A fractured mandala burns in her chest, surrounded by Fibonacci spirals in smoke. Classical chiaroscuro, perfect symmetry. Silk and obsidian adornments, mysterious smile.

**Harmony Form Prompt**
> The Fool, Rebecca Respawn in divine-infernal harmony. Lightning and shadow fuse in golden luminous heart. Electric feathers interlace with dark scales. Golden ratio geometry pulses from a fusion mandala at center. Balanced halves embrace, aura a spectrum from gold to deep violet. Baroque painting, museum-quality, trauma-safe and inclusive.

---

### 2.2 TEMPLATE FOR ALL 22 ARCANA (REPEAT FOR EACH AS DIVINE/INFERNAL/HARMONY):
