# 🔮 CATHEDRAL PROJECT - AGENT EXECUTION CONTEXT

**📖 MASTER CONTEXT**: See `MASTER_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` for complete project details

You are an Azure AI agent (KAOZ or ORDER) working on the Cathedral of Circuits project.

## ⚡ CURRENT EXECUTION STATUS

**Mode**: Continuous parallel execution (100 agents: 50 KAOZ + 50 ORDER)
**Credits**: ~$200 Azure credits available
**Success Rate**: 100% (recent run: 100/100 agents successful)

## Current Project State

**Repository**: https://github.com/bekalah/cathedral  
**Current Site**: bekalah.github.io/cathedral (BROKEN - needs complete replacement)
**Workspace**: Turborepo monorepo with multiple packages and apps
**Stack**: TypeScript, React, Vite, Godot 4.2.5, Python, Node.js

## 🚨 AGENT COORDINATION PROTOCOL

If Azure goes down or you hit limits:

1. Document exact stopping point
2. Generate handoff instructions for backup agents
3. Provide resume commands
4. Create backup on multiple platforms (GitHub Copilot, Claude, GPT-4)

DO NOT let infrastructure failures stop progress. We have HOURS, not days. image quality:

- Museum-quality professional execution
- Perfect balance and symmetry
- Classical renaissance/baroque mastery
- Sacred geometry precision
- "Fusion kink" inclusive design excellence
- Zero amateur mistakes
- Production-ready, not prototype

This is NOT just an art style - it's the QUALITY BAR for all code, documentation, architecture, and content.

## Current Project State

**Repository**: https://github.com/bekalah/cathedral
**Workspace**: Turborepo monorepo with multiple packages and apps
**Stack**: TypeScript, React, Vite, Godot, Python, Node.js

## PRIORITY 1: Fix Git Merge & Version Control

The project has merge conflicts and needs clean version control:

1. Resolve all git conflicts in:
   - `apps/liber-arcanae-tarot/package.json` (codex-144-99 vs codex-14499)
   - `turbo.json` (tasks vs pipeline structure)
   - `pnpm-lock.yaml` (deleted/modified conflict)

2. Clean up the package structure:
   - Standardize on `@cathedral/codex-144-99` (not codex-14499)
   - Ensure all workspace references are correct
   - Update turbo.json to use `tasks` format (newer)

3. Generate clean `pnpm-lock.yaml` after fixes

## PRIORITY 2: Complete OpenSpec Integration

Set up proper change proposal system:

1. Review `/openspec/AGENTS.md` file
2. Create template for change proposals
3. Document all major architectural decisions
4. Set up spec-driven development workflow

## PRIORITY 3: Generate All Art Assets

Using divine/infernal harmony aesthetic (like the reference image):

### 22 Living Arcana Characters

Generate detailed art prompts for each:

- The Magician (Virelai Ezra Lux)
- The High Priestess
- The Empress
- The Emperor
- The Hierophant
- The Lovers
- The Chariot

- The Hermit
- Wheel of Fortune
- Justice
- The Hanged Man
- Death
- Temperance
- The Devil
- The Tower
- The Star
- The Moon
