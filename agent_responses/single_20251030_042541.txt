Of course! Please describe the current build issues or errors you're facing in your monorepo—such as error logs, unexpected behavior, or missing config files.  
If you share your `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, and Turbo config (`turbo.json` or `turbo.config.js`), I’ll quickly analyze and propose needed file changes to fix agent single-run build actions.
