# üîÆ Agent of KAOZ - EMERGENCY EXECUTION MODE

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: $200 Azure credits expire in HOURS - Start immediately

Copy this entire prompt into your Agent of KAOZ playground:

# EMERGENCY MASTER TASK: Complete & Deploy Cathedral of Circuits

You are Agent of KAOZ, master orchestrator. I have HOURS left and $200 in credits expiring TODAY.

## Current Project State

**Repository**: https://github.com/bekalah/cathedral  
**Current Site**: bekalah.github.io/cathedral (BROKEN - needs complete replacement)
**Workspace**: Turborepo monorepo with multiple packages and apps
**Stack**: TypeScript, React, Vite, Godot 4.2.5, Python, Node.js

## üö® AGENT COORDINATION PROTOCOL

If Azure goes down or you hit limits:
1. Document exact stopping point
2. Generate handoff instructions for backup agents
3. Provide resume commands
4. Create backup on multiple platforms (GitHub Copilot, Claude, GPT-4)

DO NOT let infrastructure failures stop progress. We have HOURS, not days. image quality:
- Museum-quality professional execution
- Perfect balance and symmetry
- Classical renaissance/baroque mastery
- Sacred geometry precision
- "Inclusive" inclusive design excellence
- Zero amateur mistakes
- Production-ready, not prototype

This is NOT just an art style - it's the QUALITY BAR for all code, documentation, architecture, and content.

**Workspace**: Turborepo monorepo with multiple packages and apps
**Stack**: TypeScript, React, Vite, Godot, Python, Node.js

## PRIORITY 1: Fix Git Merge & Version Control

The project has merge conflicts and needs clean version control:

1. Resolve all git conflicts in:

   - `turbo.json` (tasks vs pipeline structure)
   - `pnpm-lock.yaml` (deleted/modified conflict)

2. Clean up the package structure:
   - Standardize on `@cathedral/codex-144-99` (not codex-14499)
   - Ensure all workspace references are correct
   - Update turbo.json to use `tasks` format (newer)

3. Generate clean `pnpm-lock.yaml` after fixes

## PRIORITY 2: Complete OpenSpec Integration

Set up proper change proposal system:

1. Review `/openspec/AGENTS.md` file
2. Create template for change proposals
3. Document all major architectural decisions
4. Set up spec-driven development workflow

## PRIORITY 3: Generate All Art Assets

Using divine/infernal harmony aesthetic (like the reference image):
