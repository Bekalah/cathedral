#### **Infernal**
```
Ancient, dark wheel forged of iridescent shadow-metal, etched with chaotic glyphs, whirling amid storm and fire. Creature spirits as shadowy forms. Cracked symmetry, anxious anticipation. Gothic, storm-scarred. Mood: fate‚Äôs inevitability, tumultuous energy.
```

#### **Harmony**
```
A wheel half luminous gold, half gleaming obsidian, surrounded by both angelic and demonic spirits in perfect balance. Mandala heart at axle, geometry radiating out as a rainbow spectrum. Mood: balanced change, sacred uncertainty, the dance of fate.
```
