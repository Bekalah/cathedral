# Add Bun Support to .gitignore

## Status
✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - 2025-11-01

## Context
User encountered issue with thousands of Bun cache files being staged for commit from `.bun/install/cache/` directory. This represents a common dependency management antipattern where package manager cache directories are tracked by version control.

## Problem
- Bun package manager creates `.bun/install/cache/` with thousands of cached package files
- These cache files were not excluded by existing `.gitignore` 
- Cache files should never be committed (regenerated on install, platform-specific, large size)
- Missing Bun-specific exclusions in project `.gitignore`

## Solution
Added comprehensive Bun exclusions to `.gitignore`:
```gitignore
# Bun
.bun/
bun.lockb
```

## Implementation Details
- **Location**: `/Users/rebeccalemke/cathedral-real/.gitignore`
- **Added entries**: `.bun/` (cache directory), `bun.lockb` (binary lockfile)
- **Placement**: Logically grouped with other dependency directories section
- **Scope**: Project-wide exclusion for all Bun-generated artifacts

## Verification
- ✅ Working tree clean after implementation
- ✅ No `.bun/` directories currently present
- ✅ Prevents future Bun cache tracking issues

## Dependencies
- Compatible with existing Node.js/npm/yarn/pnpm exclusions
- Maintains consistency with package manager best practices
- No conflicts with Turbo monorepo configuration

## Permanent Provenance Record
This change establishes permanent exclusion of Bun package manager artifacts from version control, preventing repository bloat and maintaining clean dependency management practices.
