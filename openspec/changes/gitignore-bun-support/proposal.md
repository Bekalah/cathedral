# Add Bun Support to .gitignore

## Status

✅ **IMPLEMENTED & COMMITTED** - 2025-11-01
**Commit**: `2b06272` - "chore(gitignore): add Bun cache and lockfile to .gitignore"

## Context

User encountered issue with thousands of Bun cache files being staged for commit from `.bun/install/cache/` directory, appearing in a massive commit message with ~10,000 files. Investigation revealed this occurred during agent work sessions running against Azure AI Foundry infrastructure.

**Agent Activity Context:**

- Agent ID: `asst_72uzK1Yt2hsu2qVyt22NkMiO` (Azure AI Foundry)
- Execution period: October 30, 2025 (~4:20 AM)
- Runs completed: 296/500 (parallel batches)
- Working environment: Cathedral monorepo with pnpm package manager

**Discovery Timeline:**

- Original git commit message showed `.bun/_bun`, `.bun/bin/bun`, `.bun/bin/bunx` plus thousands of `.bun/install/cache/*.npm` files
- Project normally uses pnpm package manager (defined in `package.json`)
- Bun installation likely triggered by agent environment setup or dependency resolution
- Cache files accumulated during agent batch processing sessions

## Problem

- Bun package manager creates `.bun/install/cache/` with thousands of cached package files
- These cache files were not excluded by existing `.gitignore`
- Cache files should never be committed (regenerated on install, platform-specific, large size)
- Missing Bun-specific exclusions in project `.gitignore`

## Solution

Added comprehensive Bun exclusions to `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
# Bun
.bun/
bun.lockb
```

## Implementation Details

- **Location**: `/Users/rebeccalemke/cathedral-real/.gitignore`
- **Added entries**: `.bun/` (cache directory), `bun.lockb` (binary lockfile)
- **Placement**: Logically grouped with other dependency directories section
- **Scope**: Project-wide exclusion for all Bun-generated artifacts

## Verification

- ✅ Working tree clean after implementation
- ✅ No `.bun/` directories currently present
- ✅ Prevents future Bun cache tracking issues

## Dependencies

- Compatible with existing Node.js/npm/yarn/pnpm exclusions
- Maintains consistency with package manager best practices
- No conflicts with Turbo monorepo configuration

## Permanent Provenance Record

This change establishes permanent exclusion of Bun package manager artifacts from version control, preventing repository bloat and maintaining clean dependency management practices.
