## Why

The current project architecture has grown organically with multiple repositories, inconsistent package structures, and outdated configurations that hinder maintainability, performance, and scalability. This refactoring aims to align everything with OpenSpec master version 1.0, consolidate redundant code, optimize build processes, and ensure a cohesive monorepo architecture that supports the full Cathedral of Circuits vision.

## What Changes

- **Consolidate Package Structure**: Merge duplicate packages, standardize naming conventions, and align with OpenSpec specifications
- **Optimize Monorepo Configuration**: Update turbo.json, pnpm-workspace.yaml, and build pipelines for better performance
- **Standardize Code Architecture**: Implement consistent error handling, validation, and module structures across Python, TypeScript, and GDScript
- **Performance Optimizations**: Reduce bundle sizes, optimize asset loading, and implement caching strategies
- **Data Integrity**: Consolidate duplicate data files, implement proper validation checks, and ensure schema consistency
- **Security Updates**: Review and update security implementations across all systems
- **Testing & CI/CD**: Implement comprehensive testing frameworks and automated pipelines
- **Documentation**: Update all documentation to reflect the new architecture

## Impact

- Affected specs: All core capabilities (cosmogenesis-learning-engine, circuitum99, stone-grimoire, liber-arcanae, tesseract-bridge, magical-mystery-house)
- Affected code: All Python, TypeScript, and GDScript files; all configuration files; all data files
- Breaking changes: Package renames, API changes, configuration updates (will be handled with migration guides)
- Benefits: Improved maintainability, performance gains, reduced complexity, better developer experience
