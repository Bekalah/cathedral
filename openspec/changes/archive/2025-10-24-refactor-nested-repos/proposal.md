## Why

The current monorepo structure has nested packages and apps that need clear boundaries to prevent "flat code vibing" and ensure modular, integrated development as per the Open Specification System.

## What Changes

- Define OpenSpec specs for core repository components (packages, apps, data)

- Establish interface contracts for integration points like tesseract-bridge

- Update project conventions to align with OpenSpec workflow

## Impact

- Affected specs: repository-structure

- Affected code: All packages and apps for better organization and integration

- Development workflow: Structured changes via OpenSpec to avoid conflicts
