# Leonora Carrington ‚Äî Pantheon & Psyche

Author: Rebecca Respawn (Bekalah)  
Provenance: CC-BY-SA-4.0 ¬∑ Source: Codex 144:99 + scholarly references  

---

## Roots
- Born Lancashire, 1917 ‚Äî Irish-Catholic family. Expelled from convent schools; trauma at repression.  
- WWII exile: asylum in Santander; rescued by surrealist friends; self-authored her recovery.  
- Settled in Mexico City, 1940s; remained lifelong.  

---

## Style
- **Surrealist yet Medieval:** jewel-like precision, like illuminated manuscripts.  
- **Alchemical grammar:** kitchens = laboratories; cauldrons = stages of the Work.  
- **Animal daimons:** hyenas, horses, birds ‚Äî threshold guides.  
- **Visionary detail:** Bosch + Tarot + Celtic myth in dream logic.  

---

## Beliefs
- **Catholic Mysticism:** Saints, Madonnas, holy fools transmuted into witches and protectors.  
- **Hermetic & Alchemy:** Read Agrippa, Paracelsus, Cabala; painted planetary correspondences.  
- **Indigenous Syncretism:** Tonantzin, Coatlicue, curanderismo motifs woven with Magdalene.  
- **Tarot & Archetypes:** Saw Fool, Priestess, Magician as living companions.  

---

## Psyche
- Trauma survivor ‚Äî asylum as initiatory underworld.  
- Reframed madness as sacred: visions as chapels, archetypes as protectors.  
- Feminist witch ‚Äî women not muses but magicians, crones, priestesses.  

---

## Influence
- Linked to: Dion Fortune (psychic architecture), Paul Foster Case (tone-color harmonics), Agrippa (correspondences), Crowley (Aeon, Tower), Frater Achad (Da‚Äôath paradox).  
- Carrington‚Äôs work = continuation of Hermetic tradition through surrealist vision.

# Room: The House of Fearless Women  
Node: Linked to Fool 00 (Aurora Gate)  
Realm: Carrington Temple ‚Äî Mystery House  

---

üåë *You step into a kitchen that is not a kitchen. Cauldrons simmer galaxies; frying pans spark halos; eggs hatch star-hyenas. A Black Madonna leans in the corner, whispering Celtic hymns and Nahuatl spells. The floor beneath is Emma Kunz geometry, alive with light.*  

Here women do not serve, they conjure. They laugh like holy fools, they stir like alchemists, they ride like saints.  

---

## ‚ú¶ Choose
- **[Stir the Cauldron ‚Äî Light]**  
  Paracelsus herbs flare; the room fills with healing steam. A companion joins you.  

- **[Call the Hyena ‚Äî Shadow]**  
  A spectral hyena answers; its laughter rattles the arches. You must withstand fear.  

- **[Crown the Madonna ‚Äî Paradox]**  
  You place a crystal in her hand; the statue shifts between Brigid, Isis, Tonantzin, Coatlicue.
