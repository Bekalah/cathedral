## 📤 How to Push (Replit Git Interface)

Replit manages git for you. Here's how to push:

### Step 1: Open Version Control
1. Click the **Version Control** icon in the left sidebar (looks like a branch/fork icon)
2. You'll see all your changes listed

### Step 2: Stage and Commit
1. Review the changes (should see all your consolidated files)
2. Enter a commit message:
   ```
   Cathedral Master v1.0 - Complete consolidation of 13 repos

   - 255 engines, 1,511 data files, 10 shaders
   - React + Rust + Godot architecture
   - OpenSpec palette, TAROT_MASTER_DATASET, Codex 144:99
   - GitHub Actions auto-deploy configured
   ```
3. Click **Commit & Push**

### Step 3: Add Remote (First Time Only)
If asked for a remote:
1. Remote name: `origin`
2. Remote URL: `https://github.com/Bekalah/cathedral-master.git`
3. Click **Add Remote**

### Step 4: Push
1. Select branch: `main` (or `master` if that's your branch)
2. Click **Push**
3. Authenticate with GitHub if prompted

## 🎯 After Pushing

### Enable GitHub Pages (Required for Live Site)
1. Visit: https://github.com/Bekalah/cathedral-master/settings/pages
2. Under "Build and deployment":
   - **Source:** Select "GitHub Actions"
3. Save

### Wait for Deployment
- Check progress: https://github.com/Bekalah/cathedral-master/actions
- First deploy: ~2-3 minutes
- You'll see a green checkmark when complete

### Access Your Live Site
Your Cathedral Master will be live at:
```
https://bekalah.github.io/cathedral-master
```

---

## 🔄 Alternative: Command Line (If Replit Shell Allows)

If you prefer command line and Replit allows it:

```bash
# Add remote (first time only)
git remote add origin https://github.com/Bekalah/cathedral-master.git

# Check current branch
git branch

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
# or if your branch is master:
# git push -u origin master
```

**Note:** Replit may restrict git commands. Use the UI method above if this fails.

## ✨ What Happens Next

1. **GitHub receives your code**
   - All 13 repos worth of content in one unified repository
   - 255 engines, 1,511 data files, 10 shaders

2. **GitHub Actions triggers**
   - Reads `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
   - Runs `npm install`
   - Builds your web platform
   - Deploys to GitHub Pages

3. **Your site goes live**
   - Public URL: https://bekalah.github.io/cathedral-master
   - Accessible worldwide
   - Auto-updates on every push

---

## 🗄️ Archive Old Repos (Optional - After Push)

Once you confirm the push worked, you can archive the old 13 repos:

```bash
node archive-old-repos.mjs
```

This marks them as read-only but keeps them visible for reference.

✅ **GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/Bekalah/cathedral-master
- All your files visible
