# Cathedral Monorepo Context for GitLab Duo

## Project Overview
Cathedral is a unified mystical technology system combining sacred geometry, consciousness interfaces, and transcendence tools.

## Key Components & Connections

### Core Systems
- `cathedral-core.ts` - Central orchestrator managing all subsystems
- `lib/codex-144-99/` - Universal canon with Hebrew letters, factions, characters
- `data-clean/` - Clean datasets for shader realms, color palettes, sacred math

### Stone Grimoire (Rosslyn Cathedral Interface)
- `packages/stone-grimoire/` - Consciousness-responsive interface
- Connects to: cathedral-core, shader-realms, design-suite
- Technologies: TypeScript, CSS sacred geometry, HTML5

### Shader Realms System  
- `lib/shaders/realm-shaders.ts` - 9 realm shaders with frequency response
- `data-clean/shader-realms/` - Realm maps, portals, inhabitants
- Connects to: Godot game, Stone Grimoire, audio processing

### Design Suite (Python)
- `design-suite/` - Sacred geometry and fractal renderer
- `hall-of-mysteries/frater_achad_system.py` - Achad integration
- Connects to: JSON export system, cross-platform rendering

### Godot Game
- `godot/` - Museum-quality 3D experience with Rust integration
- `rust-bindings/` - Sacred geometry generation for Godot
- Connects to: shader realms, design suite exports, audio system

## Build System
- Turbo monorepo with pnpm
- GitLab CI/CD with shallow clones
- Node.js 23, Python 3.11+, Rust stable

## Quality Standards
- Gemini 3 A+ Golden Standard
- Art-level mystical aesthetics
- Trauma-informed, offline-first design
