# 🔮 Complete Work Summary - All Copilot Tasks from Recent Sessions

## What Was Being Built (Context from Chat History)

This is a comprehensive Cathedral of Circuits project - a mystical, trauma-informed creative technology platform combining:

- **22 Living Arcana characters** (Major Tarot archetypes as interactive game characters)
- **Divine/Infernal harmony aesthetic** (angels + demons in sacred balance)
- **Godot 4.2.5 game engine** integration with web technologies
- **Turborepo monorepo** with multiple apps and packages
<!-- Note: Azure agent tooling was time-bound and has been decommissioned. Local-only flow retained. -->
- **Professional museum-quality** design and execution
- **Fusion kink inclusive** trauma-informed UX
- **Sacred geometry** and mystical mathematics (144:99 codex system)

## 🎯 Work In Progress When Interrupted

### Git/Version Control Issues

- Merge conflicts in `apps/liber-arcanae-tarot/package.json`
- Conflicts in `turbo.json` (tasks vs pipeline format)
- Diverged branches (local ahead by 3, remote ahead by 30)
- Need to standardize on `@cathedral/codex-144-99` package name
- Clean up and regenerate `pnpm-lock.yaml`
