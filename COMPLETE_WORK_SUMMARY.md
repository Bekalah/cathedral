# 🔮 Complete Work Summary - All Copilot Tasks from Recent Sessions

## What Was Being Built (Context from Chat History)

This is a comprehensive Cathedral of Circuits project - a mystical, trauma-informed creative technology platform combining:

- **22 Living Arcana characters** (Major Tarot archetypes as interactive game characters)
- **Divine/Infernal harmony aesthetic** (angels + demons in sacred balance)
- **Godot 4.2.5 game engine** integration with web technologies
- **Turborepo monorepo** with multiple apps and packages
- **Azure AI integration** for art and content generation
- **Professional museum-quality** design and execution
- **Fusion kink inclusive** trauma-informed UX
- **Sacred geometry** and mystical mathematics (144:99 codex system)

## 🎯 Work In Progress When Interrupted
