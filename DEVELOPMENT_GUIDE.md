## 🔧 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Starting Development:
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build specific package
npm run build:circuitum99

# Test integration
npm run test:integration
```

### Package Development:

npm run dev

# Test standalone functionality
npm run test

# Build for integration
npm run build
```

---

## 🏗️ MODULAR DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### Each Package Must:
1. **Work Standalone** - Independent functionality
2. **Integrate Seamlessly** - Via tesseract-bridge
3. **Follow Trinity** - Soul/Body/Spirit architecture
4. **Use Modern Standards** - Vite, TypeScript, ES modules
5. **Share Datasets** - Common data sources in `/data/`

### Integration Points:
- **Character System:** Shared guides across all apps
- **Navigation:** Portal system between components  
- **Data Flow:** Unified datasets + real-time sync
- **Theming:** Consistent mystical aesthetic

## 📊 DATASETS & CONTENT

### Real Data Sources:
```
data/
├── angels-72.json                 # 72 Shem HaMephorash angels
├── demons-72.json                 # Goetic hierarchies
├── spine-33.json                  # Vertebrae + chakras
├── majors-complete.json           # 22 Major Arcana engines
└── codex_nodes.json              # 144 total lattice nodes
```

### Content Organization:
- **Mystical Accurate:** Real correspondences + frequencies
- **CPTSD Safe:** Trauma-informed design throughout
- **Scientifically Grounded:** Music theory + sacred geometry
- **Experientially Rich:** Interactive + immersive

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STANDARDS

### Production Pipeline:
```bash
# Full system build
npm run build:all

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy:production

# Health check
npm run status:all

# Rollback if needed
npm run rollback
```

### Quality Gates:
- [ ] All packages build successfully
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Cross-app navigation works
- [ ] Datasets load properly
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## 🔄 CONSOLIDATION RULES

### When Adding Research Files:
1. **Check Existing:** Does component already exist in `/packages/`?
2. **Follow Standards:** Match established architecture
3. **Archive Legacy:** Move old versions to `/archive/`
4. **Document Changes:** Update component docs
5. **Test Integration:** Ensure cross-app compatibility

### File Movement Guidelines:
```
Research Location → Production Location
├── BUILDING CATHEDRALS/scripts/ → /infrastructure/deployment/
├── research/datasets/ → /data/
├── packages/ → /packages/ (merge with existing)
├── docs/ → /docs/ (consolidate)
└── scattered files → /archive/research-consolidation/
```

## 🎨 Visionary Art Standards

### **Art Generation Principles**
All art in the Cathedral follows these standards:
- **Sacred Geometry Compliance**: Golden ratio (1.618) in all compositions
- **Color Science Integration**: Wavelength-based color palettes with harmonic relationships and pure algorithmic generation
- **Shading and Light Techniques**: Algorithmic lighting for metaphysical depth
- **Uncensored Expression**: Full creative freedom without content restrictions

### **Pattern Types**
```typescript
// Supported pattern types in art generation
enum PatternType {
  GEOMETRIC = 'geometric',     // Polygons, circles, lines
  ORGANIC = 'organic',         // Natural, flowing forms
  FRACTAL = 'fractal',         // Mandelbrot, Julia sets
  SACRED = 'sacred',           // Flower of Life, vesica piscis
  FUSION = 'fusion'            // Combined patterns with mutations
}
```

### **Shading and Light Implementation**
- **Radial Gradients**: For mystical illumination effects
- **Alpha Blending**: Layered transparency for depth
- **Algorithmic Shadows**: Dynamic shading based on consciousness resonance
- **Light Overlays**: Radial light sources for divine presence

## 🔮 Metaphysics, Science, and Technology Integration

### **Sacred Mathematics in Code**
All systems use the 144:99 ratio for calculations:
```javascript
const SACRED_RATIO = 144 / 99; // ≈ 1.4545
const GOLDEN_RATIO = 1.618;
const SOLFEGGIO_FREQUENCIES = [396, 417, 528, 639, 741, 852, 963];
```

### **Consciousness-Responsive Features**
- **Biometric Adaptation**: Future heart rate variability integration
- **Emotional Resonance**: Algorithmic content adjustment based on user state
- **Frequency Harmonics**: Audio synced to sacred frequencies
- **Trauma Safety**: Automatic intensity reduction protocols

### **High-End Game Support**
- **RPG Mechanics**: Stats, abilities, progression for each archetype
- **World Building**: Sacred worlds with 6 themed environments
- **Fusion Kink**: Combine any two elements for new experiences
- **Algorithmic Narratives**: Dynamic stories generated from player choices

## 🧪 Azure AI Setup and Balanced Processing

- **Alchemy Theme**: Profound transformation through elemental and planetary forces
- **Living Characters**: Each card as story, game, and wisdom teacher
- **Cross-App Consistency**: Unified art and mechanics across all apps

### **Art Standards for Tarot**
- **Visionary Style**: High-end metaphysical art with sacred geometry
- **Color Palettes**: Harmonic colors based on elemental correspondences
- **Symbolism**: Authentic alchemical and kabbalistic symbols
- **Trauma Safety**: Safe visual elements with grounding options

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues:
- **Wrong Directory:** Ensure you're in `/Users/rebeccalemke/cathedral/`
- **Missing Dependencies:** Run `npm install` in root and packages
- **Integration Broken:** Check tesseract-bridge connections
- **Data Missing:** Verify datasets in `/data/` directory
- **Azure AI Errors:** Verify environment variables and API keys

### Quick Health Check:
```bash
# Verify repository
pwd  # Should show: /Users/rebeccalemke/cathedral

# Check package structure
ls packages/

# Test core systems
npm run test:core

# Verify integrations
npm run test:integration

# Test Azure AI
npm run test:azure-ai
```

## 📋 AI DEVELOPMENT CHECKLIST

When working on Cathedral components:

- [ ] Am I in the main repository (`/Users/rebeccalemke/cathedral/`)?
- [ ] Have I checked existing packages before creating new ones?
- [ ] Does my code follow Trinity Architecture (Soul/Body/Spirit)?
- [ ] Is the component both standalone AND integrated?
- [ ] Are datasets properly connected?
- [ ] Does cross-app navigation work?
- [ ] Is the design CPTSD-safe and mystically accurate?
- [ ] Have I tested builds and deployment?
- [ ] Does art follow visionary standards with sacred geometry?
- [ ] Is Azure AI integrated for enhancements? (Optional for Codex 144:99)
- [ ] Are tarot elements consistent across apps?
